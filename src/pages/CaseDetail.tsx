    age: 12,
    location: "Amhara Region, Ethiopia",
    summary: "How access to clean water transformed Abebe's life and his entire village in rural Ethiopia.",
    story: "Abebe Kebede, a 12-year-old boy from a small village in the Amhara Region, used to spend over three hours each day walking to collect water for his family. The closest water source was a river several kilometers away, and the water was often contaminated, causing frequent illnesses in his family and community.\n\nWhen our Clean Water Initiative reached Abebe's village in 2021, everything changed. A new well was constructed at the center of the village, providing clean, safe drinking water to the entire community. For Abebe, this meant no more long walks to fetch water, no more missed school days, and significantly improved health.\n\n'Before the well, I was sick often and couldn't attend school regularly,' Abebe says. 'Now I have time to study and play, and my younger siblings aren't getting sick as much.'\n\nAbebe's academic performance has improved dramatically now that he can attend school consistently. He dreams of becoming a doctor so he can help others in his community, a dream that seemed impossible before the water project.\n\nBeyond the immediate health benefits, the well has transformed the entire village. Women and children, who traditionally bear the burden of water collection, now have time for education, economic activities, and community engagement. A local committee, including Abebe's father, has been trained to maintain the well, ensuring its sustainability for years to come.\n\nAbebe's story is just one example of how access to clean water can transform lives. It's not just about quenching thirstâ€”it's about creating opportunities, improving health, and building stronger communities.",
